# Trials

Once a year, I take a month and I read everything I can by one author.

This year I read four books by Thomas Bernhard in one month.

And the year before that, it was everything by Denton Welch in one month.

But in --- 2009 see, --- See, this was very very dangerous --- I read everything by Franz Kafka in one month

I started with "Amerika"

It was August.

I read the castle.
