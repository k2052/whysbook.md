# DISCLAIMER 

While this printer queue might seem to be some kind of clunky and poorly construed technology, I
assure you that it is quite advanced on my end and is the only way I could find of coming to you.
The documents you’ll be reading today have been in transit for nearly a year and have arrived (I
hope) in an order which the spool process can give to you quickly and with some clarity. Please
forgive any distortion in the text, it is quite perilous to communicate this way.

Now I want to make it perfectly clear that these papers and all my other works in life belong to the
general public. In fact, I also would like to turn myself over to all of you as well. This was
actually done several years ago, but in an embarrassingly disorganized manner. I like what you’ve
done with the character, but I’d like to step into his tattered suit for the next hundred pages and
a day. And after that, I’m yours again. Do what you must do! I always enjoy seeing what happens to
me.
