That's a lot, but I think he could have done it, even alone, even with tuberculosis.

Imagine Kafka's fiendish little face rubbing his over that fire!

Seems fun.

Of course he didn't want them burned.

This was just Kafka, writing his own death.

This ending has his signature on it.

Reality's kind of a medium, maybe greater than paper.
