# You Get It

And yet completely unfinished, in my hands.

What if Amerika was only written for 32-bit Power PC?

Can an unfinished program be reconstructed?

Can I write a program and go, "Ah, Well, you get the gist of it."

If the trial was written for 32-bit Power PC, Max Brod wouldn't have to burn them! He would just be like, "How do I even get this thing off the hard drive?"
