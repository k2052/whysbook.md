The audience laughed, female laughter. Incidentally, the videotape of this program can be seen at
http://youtube.com /watch?v= ShpcjWG_Me0. (I don't know if it is proper to dump a YouTube address
here. It feels like I have maybe just gone ahead and ruined what I am writing by doing that. Has all
of this writing lost its timelessness, to have this relic here? But maybe this link will never
break, maybe it will stay there for all time. Maybe it’s me. I’m a relic which is already out of his
time in the present age. Maybe I am what is holding things back, maybe I am already not of any
relevance. Good things to consider.)

Allow me to leave the jerktoasters on Oprah’s darkened stage while I drop a name. Any of you
happened to read the work of Dr. Emery Pestus? I can’t go on with this story until you’ve read him,
he’s a big name in -nymity. Knows everything about it. Naturally, he goes on about all the things
you know already: that anonymity obscures the truth, that it opens a vent for hatred, basically that
it turns people into vile and slanderous beasts. But too often we let disguised persons slide when it comes to little poems or donations.

On that point of Anonymous donations, he writes:

```
Where one sees Anonymous etched, one witnesses the spoil of all the other names etched on the stone
beneath it. In many cases, the gift of each part is the same, but the gift of Anonymous seems
somehow the more virtuous. This lie speaks to the cynicism of our time! Where is the real man in all
of this? Where has he hidden? We hate the man who is good and who is himself.
