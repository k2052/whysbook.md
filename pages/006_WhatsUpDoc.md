# Whats Up Doc

Finding myself very impressed by Dr. Pestus’ writings, having dabbled in psuedonymity from time to
time, I dashed him off a letter:

Dr. Pestus, good afternoon.

	I am a fellow, a professor of sorts, who is doing work under an anonymous guise and I have just
	finished reading your book “Kill Yourself! The Terrible Things People Say and Do When They Aren’t
	Themselves.” Now, before you start to usher a reply, I am not writing to disagree with you.

	My complaint is that my real name is very plain and I prefer to have a fictional one. You don’t
	seem to suffer this problem, since your real name is quite fictional—sounding on its own.

	I do realize that having a fictional name makes me a bad person, but how bad of a person does it
	make me? Please rate on the scale of John Q. Public to Mister X.

	Also, is it too late to be real?

	why

His reply came in a few days:

Dear Mr. Jonathan Gillette,

	Yes, it’s true! I know your real name! I asked a few of my experts to trace back the little e—mail
	you sent and it lined up with the coordinates of one Pirate O's General Store in Draper, Utah. It
	seems that you composed the email while you were plugged into their connection, enjoying a
	Sangria Sefiorial it seems. A quick call to store owner Chase McGuinn sorted all of this out. Now
